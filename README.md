## Description

In this game, the player chooses one of the possible characters to play as. Once a character is selected, the other characters become the enemies that the player must defeat.

The player must then select an enemy to fight. Once the player selects an enemy, they they click the "Fight" button to attack the enemy. Each time the fight button is clicked, the enemy is damaged by the player's total attack power, and the enemy counter attacks and damages the player by their counter power. Each time the user attacks, their total attack power increases by an amount equal to their base attack power.

Once the enemy's HP reaches 0, the enemy is defeated, and another enemy must be selected to fight. To win the game, the player must continue selecting and fighting enemies until they are all defeated.

If the player's HP reaches 0, the user loses the game.

## Strategy

The user can win no matter which character they select. The strategy is in selecting which opponents to fight first and which to fight later after the player's attack attribute has increased.
